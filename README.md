> Restrained by the harsh truth

> That in the end they're confined

> To a cage left in dark of the night
>
> Burned by their fate, Their mind a desolate land

> Having lived a nightmare

> Few could ever understand

> And yet... clawing their way, Out of the cage they still shine
> 
> For in their heart remains their guiding light
